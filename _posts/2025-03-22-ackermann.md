Ackerman steering is a configuration for no slipping steering of wheeled vehicles.

First we analyze a 2 wheel configuration, like in a bicycle. 
Denote the separation of the 2 wheels as $$D$$, and the front angle twist relative to back is $$\theta$$.
Under no slipping condition, the separation between front point A and back point B has to be fixed at $D$.
This implies the displacement of front has to be more than the back wheel, by a factor of $1/\cos\theta$.

The motion of a rigid boy can be decomposed into translation and rotation. And note these 2 operations commute.
The turning center is given by the intersection between the perpendicular line through the wheels.
The turning radii are $OA=D/\sin\theta$ and $OB=D/\tan\theta$. Note $OB/OA=\cos \theta$.

In particular, the front wheel and back wheel trace out different trajectories.

In Ackerman steering of a 4 wheel vehicle, the back wheels are fixed and point in front. The 2 front wheel turn by different amount, engineered to be such that there is no slipping.

If the horizontal wheel separation is $H$, we can geometrically solve the outer wheel turn angle $\theta'$. This satisfies $D/\tan\theta' = H+D/\tan\theta$.

Wide turn
For a given turn radius $R$, measured from turn center $O to the back wheel, how much do we need to turn?
$R=D/\tan\theta$
