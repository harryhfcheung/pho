title: Ackermann steering
---

Ackermann steering is a configuration for no slipping steering of wheeled vehicles.

First we analyze a 2 wheel configuration, like a bicycle.
Denote the separation of the 2 wheels as $$D$$, and the front angle twist relative to back is $$\theta$$.
Under no slipping condition, the separation between front point A and back point B is constant, so the displacement of A and B along the connecting line AB have to be equal. From geometry, the displacements are related by $$d_A = d_B/\cos\theta$$.

The turning center $$O$$ is the intersection between the perpendicular line through the wheels.
The turning radii are $$OA=D/\sin\theta$$ and $$OB=D/\tan\theta$$. Note $$OB/OA=\cos \theta$$.
Note the front wheel and back wheel trace out different trajectories.

For a finite wheel width, no slipping condition is not exactly satisfied.

In Ackermann steering of a 4 wheel vehicle, the back wheels are not movable and point in front. The 2 front wheels turn by different amount such that there is no slipping.

Denote the horizontal wheel separation as $$H$$, under no slipping condition, the outer wheel turn angle $$\theta'$$ satisfies $$D/\tan\theta' = H+D/\tan\theta$$.

The turn angle $$\theta$$ for a given turn radius $$R$$, measured from turn center $$O$$ to the back wheel satisfies $$R=D/\tan\theta$$.
